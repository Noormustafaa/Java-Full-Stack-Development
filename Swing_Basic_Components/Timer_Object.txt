Java_Timer a Concept....

Absolutely! Let's break it down **super simply**, no complicated words. 🧠✨

---

## ❓ Your Question:
> Why does my timer **stop working** when I **remove this line**?

```java
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Timer is running...\nClose this to stop.");
```

---

## ✅ Very Simple Answer:

That line:
- **Shows a pop-up** window
- And it also **keeps the program running**

---

## ❌ When you **remove** it:
- Your program starts the timer
- But then it **finishes immediately**
- So the timer gets **no time to tick**
- Result = Nothing happens

---

### 🕒 Analogy:

Think of your program like a stopwatch:
- You press **Start**
- But then you **close the app** one second later

⛔ You won’t see the stopwatch run — because it closes too fast!

---

### ✅ That line keeps the program open.

> As long as the popup is open, your timer keeps running in the background.

---

## ✅ What to do instead?

If you don’t want a message box, then you need **some way** to keep the program open.

The better way is to use a **JFrame** window.

---

## ✅ Super Simple Working Example (GUI Version)

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class SimpleTimerGUI {
    
    int counter = 0;
    JLabel label;

    public SimpleTimerGUI() {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Simple Timer");
        frame.setSize(200, 100);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        label = new JLabel("Seconds: 0");
        frame.add(label);

        frame.setVisible(true);

        Timer timer = new Timer(1000, new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                counter++;
                label.setText("Seconds: " + counter);
            }
        });

        timer.start();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SimpleTimerGUI();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Now:
- The window stays open
- Timer keeps counting
- No need for `JOptionPane`

---

Let me know if you want this even simpler with no GUI — just a plain console version!
